                    In the current, growing world, marketing has been a crucial
                    component for the success of any business. It plays an
                    important role in reaching customers and boosting sales. In
                    the past, traditional marketing was employed by businesses
                    to reach their target audience. Some of the traditional
                    marketing methods are billboards,printed ads, radio ads, TV
                    ads, direct mail, telemarketing, etc. As the technology gave
                    path to various options to market the business , digital
                    marketing has gained more attention through its advanced
                    technology and innovative strategies. It uses various social
                    media networks, search engines, websites , emails etc to
                    reach target audience and gain brand visibility. Although
                    these two types of marketing are used for the same purposes
                    yet they differ in several aspects. In this blog letâ€™s look
                    into some differentiation factors between traditional and
                    digital marketing.

                  </div>

                  <h4 className="mt-3 color-title">Target audience</h4>

                  <p className="mb-15">
                    Traditional marketing focuses on a large audience, whereas
                    digital marketing helps businesses target a specific
                    audience based on their location,interests, age, etc. by
                    targeting specific audiences in digital marketing business
                    can reach the right audience and can get better ROI.
                  </p>

                  <h4 className="mt-3 color-title">Cost</h4>

                  <p className="mb-15">
                    Traditional marketing is so expensive when compared to
                    digital marketing. Traditional advertising involves TV ads
                    and billboards which are of high cost. But contrary to this
                    digital marketing helps all scales of business to engage and
                    reach their target audience in a cost effective way by just
                    utilizing social platforms and other digital ways.
                  </p>
                  <h4 className="mt-3 color-title">Analytics</h4>

                  <p className="mb-15">
                    Measuring the analytics in traditional marketing is so
                    difficult. It consumes time and effort to know how many
                    people have seen your ads and sometimes it seems hard to
                    know even that. But in digital marketing it is so easy to
                    measure the analytics and also the count of conversion
                    aiding the business to customize their strategies according
                    to these analytical reports.
                  </p>
                  <h4 className="mt-3 color-title">
                    Engagement or interaction
                  </h4>

                  <p className="mb-15">
                    We see one way communication in traditional marketing where
                    the businesses send a text to customers without any
                    interactions and feedback. Whereas digital marketing gives
                    various options to interact with the audience and also keep
                    them engaging at all times with frequent feedback and
                    opinions.
                  </p>
                  <h4 className="mt-3 color-title">Reach</h4>

                  <p className="mb-15">
                    Traditional marketing has low reach where the TV ads and
                    billboards are only seen by the audience in certain specific
                    locations. But through digital marketing ads businesses can
                    reach a global audience and increase their brand awareness
                    across the world.
                  </p>
                  <h4 className="mt-3 color-title">Personalization</h4>
                  <p className="mb-15">
                    Digital marketing enables businesses to customize their
                    marketing content based on the interest,location etc of the
                    target audience. This can help to keep the audience engaging
                    and retain them back which may lead to increased conversion
                    rate and boost sales and brand loyalty.
