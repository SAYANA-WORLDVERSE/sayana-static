In any case, this analysis can very well support and provide direction to your online marketing strategy. A SWOT analysis is also called a strength-weakness analysis. This allows you to map out where the opportunities and risks lie for your company.

      " Don't Let These 5 Conversion Killers Ruin Your Website's Potential ",
    description:
      "If you build a website as an entrepreneur, it is of course your goal that it will also convert. With a webshop you want users to make a purchase, with a service-oriented website you want visitors to contact you to purchase your service. However, the road to that moment can be long and bumpy, especially if the conversion process was not specifically taken into account when building your website. Users who drop out along the way will not result in conversions. That's why the first question we should ask ourselves is: which conversion killers should you really avoid? And then: how can you get your website to convert, so that users go through the process from start to finish? We would like to explain this to you in this blog!",

          "Those who have less experience with web design will quickly build a website based on feeling. The problem with this is that you quickly overlook certain things, such as what a really strong website actually means. Then you unknowingly quickly implement certain conversion killers. So here are the 7 conversion killers you really want to avoid.",

        sub_title: " Poor Website Loading",
        sub_description:
          "One of the biggest conversion killers is a website that loads slowly. Logical, because if users have to wait a long time, they quickly become irritated and may even get the idea that your website is not working. They then click through to the competitor's faster website, where they can go directly. That's why it's crucial to ensure your website is fast and responsive so users end up where they want to be. The solution to this problem lies in the Core Web Vitals. You can easily check these Google metrics via Search Console to see which parts still need attention. Do visitors look at a white screen for 10 whole seconds, making your website .appear to be broken? Or do certain elements of your website jump for a long time after loading, causing visitors to misclick? You can then address these points so that users do not get frustrated and leave.",

        sub_description:"If visitors don't immediately understand the point of your website and where to click to get the desired outcome, they're likely to quickly drop out and go to your competitor's clearer website. Therefore, always ensure a clear and intuitive homepage and user interface that guide users without detours to their end goal. How do you approach this? By experiencing it yourself! Open your website, preferably on mobile. What do you see? After loading, your homepage is often the first introduction that visitors have with your website. It is important that your homepage makes it clear at a glance what you do, what you offer and what benefits you have to offer. Do you have attractive banners and images to display important news, discounts or promotions (and do you see them immediately)? If not, add them! This way there can be no misunderstandings about what visitors are looking for on your website."

It's no coincidence that Google now looks primarily at the mobile experience when determining the overall user experience: that's how most users see your website.If your buttons are too small on mobile or your app is difficult to operate for some other reason, users will find this frustrating. And yes, frustrated users leave. So don't forget to check out this decisive mobile experience via Search Console."

Especially if your website contains many (sub)categories, you want users to be able to use their logical sense to quickly click through to the correct category. If not, and your users can't quickly type their query into a search bar, they'll likely return to Google and try again.The solution is clear: build in a logical menu structure and search function, so that users can find the right place via multiple routes. This way, the goal comes into view as quickly as possible and they do not get frustrated along the way."

        sub_description:"Trust also plays an important role in conversions. If your website appears unbelievable and unreliable, visitors will hesitate to take action. Then they are less likely to leave their details with you, for fear that it could be misused. They are also less likely to make purchases, possibly because they are afraid that orders will not arrive.That's why it's essential to be transparent about your business and provide your contact information in a clear place. Add a clear 'About us' page, offer multiple ways to make contact and ensure that visitors can leave (honest) reviews, preferably even at product level. This way, visitors know exactly who you are and what they can expect from you."
